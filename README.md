### The Problem
CEOs and asset managers lose billions every year on bad strategic decisions due to optimism bias, AI hallucinations, and data leakage from cloud tools.

### The Solution
Phantom runs **100% locally** on Llama 3 and uses the proprietary LOCK-3 framework to issue deterministic GO/BLOCK verdicts — no hallucinations, no leaks.

### Traction
- Validated by Sean Michael Murphy (MedAx Capital, $25M+ AUM)
- 2 formal Letters of Intent from Series B founders
- Blind audits caught $10M–$85B level strategic errors

### Tech Stack
- Python 3.11
- Llama 3 (local)
- PyTorch + Transformers

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saffatislam89-dotcom/prorigin-phantom.git
cd prorigin-phantom
pip install -r requirements.txt
